# Meteorological Basic Types (MET-Basic)
MET-Basic provides a palette of quantity value classes specializing Measure (from ISO 19103), or subclasses thereof, and a palette of «CodeList» classes, for expressing nominal values of meteorological, hydrological and oceanographic physical properties.

The physical properties defined in MET-Basic are organized according to the scheme used in WMO FM-92 (GRIB).  It includes an additional "Aeronautical Meteorology" discipline and properties drawn from BUFR (usually relating to code-lists) that have no equivalent in GRIB2.

MET-Basic had released only once (1.0RC1) and there were no further development of the package since then.
